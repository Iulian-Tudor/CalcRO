# Introduction-to-Programming - Project
First project assigned while in my first year of college. 

The task was to create a Calculator program that would take input from user in natural language (Romanian, but can be more easily adapted to English due to simpler language sintax and sentence structure). It would then "translate" said sentece of varying length and multiple of any basic operations, with proper parantheses placement into an arithmetic formula. Lastly, it would calculate the result of said formula and return it to the user also in natural Language.

Example: 

input: "Cat face trei plus patru impartit la doi?"

output: "2 virgula 5"

The constraints are that so far it only accepts pozitive real numbers, as the method of utilizing keywords for operations, for now, cannot distinguish between 'minus' as the operation and 'minus' as the sign in front of a number inside that formula.
